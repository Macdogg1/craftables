# <u>Craftables v1</u>

## <u>**About**</u>

The Craftables datapack for Minecraft enhances the crafting system by adding new recipes for items that were previously unobtainable through crafting. It also tweaks several existing recipes to improve balance or add variety. With this datapack, players can craft things like enchantment books, more useful building materials, or even items that were once limited to rare drops or commands. Whether you're looking to make your survival experience more versatile or just enjoy discovering new crafting possibilities, Craftables opens up a whole new world of crafting options.

Please note that the 'Craftables' datapack is still in the early development stages, and I'd love to hear your suggestions! Feel free to reach out to us on Discord or leave a comment on our CurseForge page.
